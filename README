AIR Pump - Version 0.1a - 04.04.12AIR Pump is a JSFL command for Flash Professional IDE that allows for custom AIR adt.jar command line arguments and execution of adt.jar of any version of the AIR SDK to be leveraged directly from the Flash IDE. Thus providing access to AIR adt.jar commands, features and functionality normally only available from the command line and not from within the IDE itself.It is designed to be an aid to workflow and efficiency when working with Flash Professional and AIR, and to assist in automating repetitive, and error prone processes.TODO:1. Make sure everything works cross platform (Mac/Win)2. Additional options and streamlinging of selection process/config/preferences/etc.3. Replace all the XUL Dialogs with a custom SWF for a single panel that replicates all the standard AIR Publish Settings dialog plus the existing functionality of AIR Pump.4. Integrate custom adt.jar shim and other functionality from other related project: http://www.impossibilities.com/v4/2011/06/24/leverage-air-2-7-ipa-test-interpreter-target-mode-for-ios-in-flash-cs-5-5/ 5. Package up in a proper .mxp file for easier installation.6. Finish TODO list with other thoughts and ideas.
